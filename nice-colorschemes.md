A lot of these colorschemes depend on the `flazz` package, which was causing me
some very weird `background=light` issues (I think...) so a lot of these just
don't work on straight up vim :(

The current colorscheme I use is `PaperColor`. It is fantastic. Inspired by
Material UI by google, it is vibrant and has great mappings for most languages.

TODO: Go through all of these colors and decide which ones are actually decent
TODO: Get some sample files to test out these colorschemes on
