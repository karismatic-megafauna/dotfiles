# Welcome To my Dotfiles!

Aspiring to use a barebones vim + tmux + fzf + ag setup on OSX, only extending where it makes sense!

### Some cool things I like about my dotfiles:

 - Random color schemes! Great for trying new things :)
 - using rcm by thoughtbot
 - focus on out of the box usage where it isn't an absolute pain *cough* remap your capslock *cough*
 - use my own zsh theme `agency` based off of `bureau`
 - node version in my PS1 (saved my ass so many times)
 
### Things to know if you are snooping around:

- Leader key for VIM is <Space>
- Prefix for tmux is `Ctrl + a` (capslock + a)
- I remap `capslock` to ctrl, this affects a lot of my motivation for custom key bindings
- Movement and resizing in tmux try to emulate vim, this CAN be confusing ( sorry )! 

Feedback on what you think is silly, useless or could be better is much appreciated. Make an issue!!!

Would love to share common stuff via `rcm` if it makes sense :)

Cheers!
